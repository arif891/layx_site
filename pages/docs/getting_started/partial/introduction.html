        <h5>Introduction to LayX</h5>
        <p>
            LayX is a modern, extensible layout framework built to simplify and accelerate web development. 
            By integrating modular CSS, customizable components, and a responsive grid system, LayX allows developers to 
            craft dynamic, scalable, and maintainable websites efficiently. It focuses on flexibility, minimalism, and performance 
            optimization without relying on third-party dependencies.

        <h6>How LayX Works</h6>
        <p>
            LayX is a lightweight CSS framework similar to Bootstrap but with a modern, modular design philosophy. 
            It features an integrated build tool and command-line interface (CLI) that adheres to the latest web standards. 
            LayX optimizes performance through techniques like image compression, code bundling, and minification. 
            The CLI simplifies project management by enabling quick addition of fonts, components, and reusable code blocks. 
            Since LayX is dependency-free, all styles and scripts are crafted using pure CSS and JavaScript.

        <h6>Efficiency in Development</h6>
        <p>
            Starting a project from scratch can be challenging and time-consuming. LayX simplifies this process by offering 
            ready-to-use building blocks, allowing developers to focus on creating unique features. 
            With a single command, <code>layx create</code>, you can scaffold a new project instantly, 
            providing a robust foundation that accelerates the development workflow.

        <h6>Performance Optimization</h6>
        <p>
            LayX ensures that only the necessary code is shipped, resulting in lean and efficient builds. 
            Shared resources are bundled into base CSS and JavaScript files, while page-specific styles and scripts 
            are isolated, reducing overhead. The integrated build tool optimizes images, bundles, and minifies CSS and JS files 
            to enhance performance further. With zero dependencies, LayX relies purely on vanilla CSS and JavaScript, 
            ensuring maximum compatibility and lightweight output.
